<h2>SCVCM</h2>
<p>This SCVCM (Self-Calibration Variance-Component Model) software is a Matlab prototype program for downscaling GRACE-derived total water storage anomaly (GRACE TWSA) from its original coarse spatiotemporal resolution (monthly, ~300km) to a high resolution (daily, 5km) using land surface model (LSM) simulated high spatiotemporal resolution terrestrial water storage anomaly (LSM TWSA).</p>

<h3>Objective</h3> 
<p>Downscaling GRACE terrestrial water storage anomaly (GRACE TWSA) from its original coarse monthly resolution (monthly ~300km) to a high spatiotemporal resolution (daily 5km)</p>

<h3>Method</h3>
<p>Two-step downscaling by using high spatiotemporal resolution terrestrial water storage anomaly simulated by a Land Surface Model (LSM TWSA). Here, we used the LSM Ecological Assimilation of Land and Climate Observations (EALCO) developed by Dr. Shusen Wang at Natural Resources Canada as an example.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Step 1: Using the iterative adjustment method based on the self-calibration variance-component model (SCVCM) to downscale the monthly GRACE TWSA spatially to the high resolution grid of the monthly LSM TWSA
<li>Step 2: Downscale the spatially downscaled monthly GRACE TWSA temporally to the high resolution grid of the daily LSM TWSA
</ul>
