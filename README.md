This SCVCM (Self-Calibration Variance-Component Model) software is a Matlab prototype program for downscaling GRACE-derived total water storage anomaly (GRACE TWSA) from its original coarse spatiotemporal resolution (monthly, ~300km) to a high resolution (daily, 5km) through combining land surface model (LSM) simulated high spatiotemporal resolution terrestrial water storage anomaly (LSM TWSA).
